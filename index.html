                                art form.</strong> It serves as a way for people to express them selves and to be
                            creative. Each photograph tells a unique story through composition, lighting and subject
                            matter. Photography can change the way an individual sees the world around them.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph"> Photography<strong> encourages creativity.</strong> It allows people to
                            capture their unique experiences interpritations of the world. By exploring composition,
                            lighting, and perspective, photographers learn to observe details that often go unnoticed,
                            enhancing their appreciation for everyday moments. This artistic expression not only boosts
                            self-confidence but also allows for personal storytelling, giving individuals a unique way
                            to communicate their experiences and emotions. As they experiment with different techniques
                            and styles, photographers continually challenge themselves, sparking innovation and
                            expanding their creative boundaries.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph"> Photography also helps to <strong>deepen an individual's connection to
                                nature and wildlife</strong>, while encouraging exploration and mindfulness. When
                            photographers venture outdoors to capture the beauty of nature and wildlife they are able to
                            connect with it on a deeper level. It creates a deeper appreciation for the environment,
                            photographers often seek to document and protect the beauty that they encounter.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph"> Photography contributes to an individual’s mental well-being by
                            encouraging mindfulness and self-expression. It allows individuals to immerse themselves in
                            the present moment, which in turn helps to decrease stress levels, by focusing on framing,
                            subject matter and lighting. Through exploring new environments and experimenting with
                            different techniques a deeper connection to one’s surroundings is formed, helping to boost
                            overall mental health.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"> Aperture can be defined as the opening in a lens through which light passes to enter
                the camera. The way I like to think about it is it helps to control the focal point. The higher your
                apeture, the more of the foreground will be in focus and the lower your apeture, the more of the
                background will be in focus.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">ISO controls the amount of light your camera lets in, and therefore how dark or light
                your photos will be. Here are some top tips to help calculate correct exposure: Low values, such as ISO
                100, are best for a sunny outdoor shoot. For shooting at night use an ISO of 1600 or higher.</p>
